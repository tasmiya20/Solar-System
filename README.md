# Solar-System
This project is a Realistic Solar System Simulation built with Pygame, providing a visual representation of planets orbiting the Sun at speeds proportional to their real-life orbital velocities. The simulation includes labeled orbits, dynamic starry background, and background music for an immersive experience.
# Features:

Realistic Planetary Motion: Each planet orbits the Sun at a unique speed and distance.

Dynamic Star Background: Randomly generated stars create a realistic space environment.

Responsive Design: The simulation adjusts to window resizing.

Background Music: Enhances the user experience.
# Tools:

Python & Pygame: For developing graphics and animations.

MP3 Background Music & PNG Images: For enhanced visual and auditory experience.
